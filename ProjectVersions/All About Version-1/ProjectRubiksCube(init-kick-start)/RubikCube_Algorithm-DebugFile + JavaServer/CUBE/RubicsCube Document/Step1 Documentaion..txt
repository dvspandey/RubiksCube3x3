Step:1 The Daisy 
=================
[One center yellow pice + 4 white edge pices]

> Start with holding your cube with yellow center pointing Up.
> Look top layer first

posibilities
-------------
	> If you start with no center edge on top face that's OK
	> If you see any one white edge pice on top face so leave it as it is. 
	> you might have some white pice on the top layer edge but that edge 2nd color is not white which touching yellow center.

	> Next looking on the middle layer and you find a white edge pice and also up face have white edge on same why so, if you move this L/R then it 
will pump the white edge pice of top face.
So, all you need to do you just turn the up face U and create space on top face.
	> If next edge pice at buttom edge so just need to face Twice R2/F2..
	> if next edge pice at last buttom layer edge pice so just rotate the Up face U and create the space.and turn face twice.
